## Executive Summary

Real time language translation is an important area of research. As the world becomes more interconnected, there is a growing interaction between the disparate groups. This project seeks to address these issues by removing the language barrier between these groups. We outline and build a system for near-real-time translation that can run on low power hardware. Utilizing the widespread Raspberry Pi platform and high-availability Google Cloud, users can leverage the latest advances in AI to get quality real time translation. This will remove language barriers that the users may experience without the need to expensive hardware.
